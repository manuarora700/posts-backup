Ever wanted to fetch your recent articles from your Hashnode powered blog and display on your portfolio site? You can now do that using Hashnode's GraphQL APIs. ðŸ¥³

> To play around with our APIs, please visit  [api.hashnode.com](https://api.hashnode.com)

## Listing your recent posts

Here is the GraphQL query you need to run:

```
query{
  user(username:"sandeep") {
    publication {
      posts(page:0) {
        title
        brief
        slug
        cuid
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Endpoint: `https://api.hashnode.com`

Simply replace `username` with your Hashnode username. Here is a simple CodeSandBox demo with code examples:

## Showing a particular blog post

To get a single blog post, run the following query:

```
query {
  post(slug:"how-to-achieve-truly-zero-downtime-deployment-using-pm2", hostname:"sandeep.dev") {
    title,
    slug,
    cuid,
    coverImage,
    content,
    contentMarkdown
  }
}
```

Endpoint: `https://api.hashnode.com`

Just tweak `slug` and `hostname` params to personalize the above query. Here is another CodeSandBox example to help you get started.
