Centering content in CSS is something that beginners struggle a lot with. CSS provides a lot of options that allow you to center content inside a container. We'll try some of the most commonly used ones.

## Centering text

Let's start by learning how to center text in a container

```
<!--  our html has a container and text content inside -->
<div class="container center">
  this text should be centered
</div>
    
```
We can center the text content using `text-align: center`. Here's is how our CSS looks

```
/* Just to see how big the container is*/
.container {
  background: black;
  font-size: 2rem;
  color: turquoise;
  height: 400px;
}

.center {
  text-align: center;  /* horizontally center aligns the text */

  vertical-align: middle;  /* aligns the text in the middle of the `line-height` of the text*/
}
```
