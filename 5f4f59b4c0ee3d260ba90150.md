If you are building a serious project, you should probably use something like Sentry to get error reports. However, if you are not using such a tool and want to check console errors on phone, here are 3 easy steps:

- Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://inspect`.

- Click on "Start Logging"

- Open a new tab and load your website. Now come back to `chrome://inspect` tab and see the logs!

I used this method for one of my hobby projects and thought it might help someone.
