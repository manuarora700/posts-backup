# What is HTML?
HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is a standard mark up language that is used for creating web pages. 

It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. This content can be structured within a paragraphs, links etc. using elements, links, tags, and attributes.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is responsible for maintaining and developing HTML specifications, along with providing regular updates.

**NB:** *HTML is not a programming language*

## Parts that makes up an HTML element

HTML elements are what makes up the HTML document in general. The HTML elements is a piece of a markup language that is used to write HTML contents.

[Here is a link to all the HTML tags (W3Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/default.asp)

Contents in an HTML is wrapped within a tag. 

```<tagname attributes="">Place your content here...</tagname>``` 

An HTML document is made up of a tag, attribute and the content which contains what to be displayed.

**Tag**: This indicates the beginning and end of an HTML element in an HTML document.

**Attributes**: this are special words that are used inside the opening tag to control the behavior of the HTML elements. This serves as the property of the elements. There are numerous attributes to control the properties of the HTML element. 

[Here is a list of various HTML attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp)

Here is an example of an HTML element


```<h1 class="main-heading">This is a heading</h1>```

# Global Attributes
Global attributes are attributes that can be used in all HTML elements except empty tags (i.e tags that that do not have closing tags). This attributes can be used in any tags regardless of what elements. This attributes control general properties of a text or display such as  language, style, direction etc.

## Class
The class attribute is used in pointing tags in a stylesheet or JavaScript. The class attribute is like a pointer which is used to reference the elements from other sources e.g. CSS, JavaScript etc. to effect changes. 

**NB:** Multiple class names can be used on one element. 
For example if, we want to use a class name to change the   main-heading class to red and the text to green.

## Id 
The id is a unique identifier to used to identify a single HTML element.  The main difference between an id and a class is that, an id can only target one element, but a class can target multiple classes. 

We can also use the id to perform the same operation

## Lang
This attribute specifies the language of the element's content. This is scarcely used in the body portion of the HTML layout, but it is commonly used in the meta tag. It is important for semantic meaning. I'll be discussing more of this in my upcoming article title **"Aria Roles"**. For us to use this attribute, we include it in the opening tag of our element and specify the language we are using. 

**NB:** *Using this attribute does not automatically translate our content, as we need to write the language plainly and correctly. *

#### Syntax
```
<tagname lang="language_code">Write your content here ........ </tagname>
```

The language code specfies what language we are using. 

[Here is a full list of the language(s) and their ISO codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)

Here is a sample code

## Style
The style attribute is an inline method of applying styles to our HTML contents. Although this method is scarcely used and highly discouraged while writing codes, it is still a valid way of styling our content.

#### Syntax

```
<tagname style="style_definitions">Write your content here...</tagname>
```
Our style definitions can be height, width, position, display, color, text-align etc.
More of this will be discussed in our CSS articles.


Here is a code sample,

## Dir

The dir attribute is used to set the base direction of a text for display. This attribute is very important for text that supports right-to-left scripts e.g. Arabic, Hebrew etc.

#### Syntax
```
<tagname dir="text-direction">Write your content here...</tagname>
```

The attribute's value (text-direction) can be of three values, viz

**ltr** - left-to-right. This reads our text from right to left

**rtl**- right-to-left. This reads our text from left to write

**auto** - lets the browser figure out the text-direction, based on the content

Here is an example code

## Data-* 
This is the last but not the least attribute and this attribute helps us to embed a custom data attributes on an HTML elements. 

#### Syntax
```
<tagname data-{attribute}="value">Write your content here...</tagname>
```

**NB:** *Anything can be used in the curly braces to pass the required data.*

This data can be used for a wide range of functions in both CSS and JavaScript.
